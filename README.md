# Our Hugging Face

Repository that keeps track of all code written to work with Hugging Face models locally. 

We have the folders: 

- `api/`: contains all code to run models through api calls to our remote computer (pc-mirko, with an Nvidia A6000 GPU);
- `tests/`: contains all tests of the models;

The following reposuitories are instead shadowed and only present on the remote computer:
- `models/`: contains all models downloaded from HF.
